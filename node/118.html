<p>Bicycle Chain accepts cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover credit cards. Please do not mail cash. If you wish to apply for credit, please complete an application. Credit specific terms and conditions are attached to the application.</p>
<h3>Return Policy</h3>
<p>Please read the following for information about returns; but before you do, please take note that we are a small business that loves what we sell, and are here to give you good products quickly. If you ever have a problem with anything here please let us know.</p>
<p>All returns must be pre-authorized within 7 days for a complete refund and returned within 14 days of notification. Products must be unused and in original wrapper and condition. Returns not pre-authorized and returned after 7 days will be given store/web credit. No returns will be accepted after 21 days under any circumstances. For all orders placed during the month of December, returns must be pre-authorized within 7 days after December 25th. After 7 days, store/web credit will be issued. Shipping charges are non-refundable under any circumstances. If you receive a damaged product, please notify us immediately. If it was damaged in shipment, we will file a carrier (USPS, UPS or FEDEX) claim. If it is a manufacturer's defect, we will authorize a return, and will refund the cost of shipping the product back to us once we determine that the manufacturer was at fault. There are no shipping refunds for return products except as just stated. No refunds will be issued on sale merchandise.</p>
<h3>Minimum Order Policy</h3>
<p>We have a $5.00 minimum order requirement. If you don't meet the requirement we will charge a handling fee for the balance until $5.00 is reached.</p>
<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
<p>If an item has inadvertently been priced wrong, we have the right to cancel the sale. Prices can change at any time.</p>
<h3>Shipping Information</h3>
<h4>Free Shipping on orders OVER $150</h4>
<p>Bicycle Chain is pleased to offer free shipping on orders over $150 within the U.S. (including Alaska and Hawaii).</p>
<h4>Shipping on orders UNDER $150</h4>
<p>All orders under $150 begin at $5.00 and are based on delivery speed, weight and location.</p>
<p>For standard shipping, orders are usually shipped USPS Priority mail. Heavy and oversized items may be shipped via UPS or FedEx, at Bicycle Chains discretion.</p>
<h4>Order Timeframes</h4>
<p>All in stock orders will be processed within 2 business days. USPS shipping time is 2-5 business days within the continental U.S., 5-9 business days to U.S. non-mainland and 6-10 days to Canada. Express orders received by 1pm CST will ship the next business day.</p>
<h4>Shipping Materials</h4>
<p>Whenever possible, Bicycle Chain strives to reuse packing materials and boxes. As such, the outer box of your shipment may contain third party logos, stickers or other markings.</p>
<h4>Incorrect Shipping Addresses</h4>
<p>Bicycle Chain does not assume responsibility for orders placed with incorrect shipping or delivery information. If for any reason a wrong address is given to us, or any part of the address is wrong, our carriers may charge a fee of $5.00 to make that correction. In turn, a charge up to $5.00 may appear on your credit card to cover this mistake. If it is our mistake, no charge will occur.</p>
<h4>Local/Pick-up Option</h4>
<p>If you are local and would like to pick up your order, please select the "Local/Pick-up" option at checkout and include a message in the order comments of when you will be picking it up your order. If you do not pickup your items within 7 days of purchase we may decide to ship the items to you at an additional expense. If not stated in the order comments, please call or email to arrange for pick-up of your order.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<h4>What Personal Information About Customers Does Bicycle Chain Gather?</h4>
<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at bicyclechain.com and ebikewheels.com.</p>
<h4>Information You Give Us:</h4>
<p>We receive and may decide to store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.</p>
<h4>Automatic Information:</h4>
<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses bicyclechain.com or ebikewheels.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.</p>
<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>
<p>To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we sometimes receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from bicyclechain.com if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us via our <a href="../contact.html">contact form</a> or give us a call at (651) 489-4513.</p>
<h4>Information from Other Sources:</h4>
<p>We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</p>
<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize you and to provide features such as personalized greetings and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.</p>
<p>The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of bicyclechain.com's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
<h3>Does Bicycle Chain Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries controlled by Bicycle Chain Inc. that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Service Providers:</h4>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purpose.</p>
<h4>Promotional Offers:</h4>
<p>Sometimes we send offers or general information to select groups of Bicycle Chain customers. You will only receive an e-mail from us if your settings approve. If you do not want to receive such e-mails please contact us.</p>
<h4>Business Transfers:</h4>
<p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Bicycle Chain Inc, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<h4>Protection of Bicycle Chain and Others:</h4>
<p>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Bicycle Chain, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<h4>With Your Consent:</h4>
<p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
<h3>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h3>
<p>Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites. These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.</p>
<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of Bicycle Chain features and services.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please let us know. If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern on bicyclechain.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</p>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you may not be able to all bicyclechain.com features. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet.</p>
<h3>Are Children Allowed to Use bicyclechain.com?</h3>
<p>Bicycle Chain does not sell products for purchase by children. We may sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may purchase from bicyclechain.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
<h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
<p>If you have any concern about privacy at Bicycle Chain, please let us know and we will try to resolve it.</p>
<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice changes also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
<p>Credit-card fraud is a criminal offense. For your protection all transactions are carefully monitored and logged including IP addresses, ISP, and other pertinent information.</p>
<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
