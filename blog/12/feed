&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend and former bike mechanic once told me &quot;life is way easier when you have the right tool for the job.&quot; This rule was ingrained into my head during an episode where I was scolded for using a crescent wrench to tighten my pedals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme resurged when I began researching bicycling options for me and the baby. I knew I didn&#039;t want a trailer, as they&#039;re pretty low to the ground, face backward, and I always think cars are going to be shortsighted (literally) and hit them. I had also heard nightmare stories about how kids learn to wriggle themselves out of them. My 6 month old is already an escape artist on a few levels. I wanted an option where I could keep my eyes on her. So, the next viable option was a seat to attach to my top tube/handlebars. This seemed dangerous on a few fronts (see: Emily falls on her bike often). As a parent, the worst thing is when your child is in pain, topped only by when that pain is accidentally caused by you, their caregiver. All I could imagine with having a seat attached to my bike was falling over and watching my strapped in kid flail around. No thanks. I decided a cargo bike was for me, but what kind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a trike. Something classy and easy to ride, yet safe for the kiddo et all. After reading a few family biking blogs I found Christiania bikes, out of Denmark. Although it seemed like a decent bike, it was a little too much of a bucket. She&#039;d probably have a great time bouncing around in there most of the time, but it wasn&#039;t going to fulfill our 3+ season &quot;minivan of a bikes&quot; desire. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a great bike, but it seemed like a rough ride, cold in the winter, and mostly unprotected. Classy, yes, but ultimately not what I&#039;m going for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say here, that I love to bikeâ€¦I really love it. And, although I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m not one of those people who has a bike for every occasion, I&#039;m clearly on my way. My usual ride BK (before kid) is a Surly Cross Check with a touring configuration. I wanted the &quot;family&quot; bike to be like my Cross Check, something I can use in 99% of my riding conditions. The Christiania wasn&#039;t going to cut it. I wanted something that said more than &quot;this is my super cool cargo bike that I tote the kid around 3 months out of the year for our ride to the grocery store.&quot; The Christiania looks classy but doesn&#039;t seem to meet my needs 99% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when I was introduced to the Winther Kangaroo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Winther Kangaroo was made with the intention of carrying children. Perfect! It&#039;s not a mountain bike pulling a trailer, or a cargo bike trying to be kid friendly. It&#039;s simply (yet quite exquisitely) a child hauler. The right tool for the job indeed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three wheels provide stability in slippery conditions and lets me stay seated at stop lights. Hydraulic disc brakes on front the two front wheels provide balanced stopping power. It&#039;s difficult to have perfectly balanced stopping power with cable-pulled breaks. With a 7 speed internal-geared hub with coaster brake on the rear, weather-resistant PVC-free hood, patented 3 point adjustable steering system, and independently suspended cabin with torsion axle, it meets and exceeds my expectations. My favorite part is the child compartment: it has 2 fully adjustable seats (or 4 if you choose the 4 kid model) that can face forward, rear, or one forward and one rear. They&#039;re attached with quick release levers for easy on-the-go-adustment, and are made of mesh with a sturdy aluminum frame for an extra comfortable ride. They even lay flat for nap time! The compartment also has an impact resistant base that acts as a giant helmet and torsion axle suspension, making for a smooth ride for the wee ones. The steering is adjustable to 6 different positions, AND, the suspension on the front wheels is configured so you can roll on high tire pressure, making it easier to propel your cargo. The child compartment also has windows on each side that can be opened or closed for maximum airflow or airtightness, a must in Minnesota. They are integrated into the cover so it&#039;s not something you have to remove and replace as weather conditions change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part about the Kangaroo is its versatility. I foresee making it our only vehicle, warm, airtight, and stable for the colder, icy months; plenty of storage for kids, gear, and a picnic basket for a trip to the beach in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&#039;ve learned about baby and kid products is, you have to think of everything, and it seems the people at Winther have. For instance, if you&#039;re only carrying one kid, you can remove one of the seats and move the other to the center of the compartment for even weight distribution (although, I&#039;m sure  the neighborhood kids will be begging to ride along). It&#039;s the little things that impress me. Yes, it&#039;s a huge investment, but it fits kids up to about 10 years old (which I&#039;m going to say includes me because I can make myself that small if need be, and if I can be then toted around in a bike), and has a cargo rating of 220 pounds, not including the rider! The Kangaroos are due to arrive in a few weeks and I suspect they&#039;ll garner a lot of attention and hopefully my child will love it as much as I already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
