&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #747474; font-family: &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;Folklore tells me that every seven years the cells of the human body completely regenerate, that it devours itself and re-emerges as something influenced by, but entirely separate from its original form. Science can disprove this, but it is a compelling myth, one for which I will temporarily suspend my disbelief. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #747474; font-family: &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;On February 22nd I will complete my seventh year of working at the Bicycle Chain. On the same day, I will conclude that chapter and begin a new one. The things that are ingrained in me--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;the people, the ideas, and the experiences that shaped a crucial period of my life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;--will be no less a part of me, but I will wear new skin, breathe through a new mouth, and move with new limbs. There is no synopsis to be written, no grand finale to be pantomimed. It is an individual&#039;s evolution, too mired in the consequence of the moment to be anything other than a passing instance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #747474; font-family: &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;There are things I will miss. Bike shops attract good people. It&#039;s a job, of course, but the impetus for the work is &lt;em&gt;purposeful&lt;/em&gt;. It offers the opportunity to be part of a transformative process that will further an individual&#039;s state of well being, sense of accomplishment, and ability to live peacefully, sustainably, autonomously, and organically in her or his environment. I was drawn into the cycling world by the co-opted image of the urban fixed gear cyclist, his sweet messenger bag, and sticker-adorned iBook. Somewhere during the journey, I learned to appreciate the infinite capacity, accessibility, and scalability of the bicycle experience. It was sport, recreation, transportation, and &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;--a philosophical playground that quickly adapted to the exigencies of the human sentiment. Aw, love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #747474; font-family: &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;The people with whom I have shaped this part of my life will remain irreplaceable, and the experience, one that I reflect on with immense gratitude. So, I say &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;good-bye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;, but I do so happy in the knowledge that I have been a part of something wonderful, and that from that thing, our intertwined lives will continue to flourish. Thank you all. You&#039;ve been amazing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_google_plusone&quot; g:plusone:size=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you&#039;ll find a quick, completely biased, sometimes uninformed assessment of a handful of random things that I&#039;ve been using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/bicyclechain.com/files/u5/transalpine_0_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Deu&quot; width=&quot;254&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deuter Transalpine 25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, I have been a rack and panniers kind of guy. Well, in order to purchase a house, I needed to make certain compromises in my bike collection. Namely, I needed to transition from the sort of guy who owns six bikes, to a guy who owns just two bikes. Consequently, my bikes need to be able to do many different things without significant modification. Hence, the backpack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been surprised how easily I transitioned. The Transalpine is supremely comfortable, with an overwhelming number of features, pockets, and hidden surprises. An integrated rain cover has allowed me to completely disregard the day&#039;s weather forecast, simply stopping on the side of the road and pulling out the rain cover from the cleverly concealed pocket. The external helmet straps are great for both stowing my helmet during social engagements and carrying awkward objects that do not fit inside the bag. Little pockets on the front, back, and inside the bag have proved valuable in organizing tools, electronics, money, etc. Even though I&#039;ve never put a map in the map pocket, I have used it during my trip to Las Vegas to keep my boarding pass both accessible and safe. I really can&#039;t say enough good things about this bag. My only complaint is unrelated to cycling. For hiking, the bag sits a little bit higher than I would like. The 30 liter version would perhaps be a much better choice for non-cycling application, where the extra torso length would make for a better fit for someone my height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/bicyclechain.com/files/u5/garmin600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garmin 610&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garmin Forerunner 610&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in 2006 and 2007 I first dabbled in the exciting world of using a GPS for training. I was preparing for my first marathon, and I wanted to be able to track my progress. The Forerunner of that era was big, bulky, awkward, and took forever for satellite sync-up. Still, it was pretty cool. Around 2009 or 2010, I took a break from running and got rid of it. A couple years passed, technology improved, and when I decided to once again enter the GPS market, I found a much more exciting product. This thing &lt;em&gt;actually looks like a watch&lt;/em&gt;. It is small, streamlined, and works incredibly well. The battery life is quite good, considering its diminutive size. I managed to get the entire Heck of the North ride recorded--with heartrate--even though it was eight and a half hours from start to finish. That&#039;s just impressive. It transitions quickly between running and cycling, so I can easily use it to track my activity for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/bicyclechain.com/files/u5/altra_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Altra Instinct&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altra Instinct&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Okay, okay...this isn&#039;t a running blog...I get it. Well, I have had a couple people ask me about running gear, so I declare it entirely appropriate. So, the Altra Instinct hung around in my closet for quite a while before recently becoming my go-to running shoe. I used them a lot for non-running activities like uhhh...going to the store, and such. I liked them a lot. The &quot;zero drop&quot;, wide toe area, and lack of &quot;support&quot; felt oh so natural. After injuring my knee at Superior, I needed to teach myself how to run properly again. To help facilitate this, I began running regularly in these. It took perhaps a week, but I once again felt at ease with my running stride. I was striking at the midfoot, keeping proper posture, and not over-striding (especially downhill). The subsequent, dramatic improvement in my IT band injury confirmed that it was an appropriate measure to take. I may still use my Hokas for exceptionally long or rocky runs, but the Instinct has become my favorite daily use shoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Transport a bike with a bike: option #1</title>
 <link>http://bicyclechain.com/node/133</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-addthis field-type-addthis field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style  &quot; addthis:title=&quot;Transport a bike with a bike: option #1 - Bicycle Chain&quot; addthis:url=&quot;http://bicyclechain.com/node/133&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_google_plusone&quot; g:plusone:size=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many (all?) cyclists, efficiently transporting a bike with another bike is &lt;em&gt;a really big deal&lt;/em&gt;. So, this will be the first in a one million part series on transporting a bike (and perhaps later we will address &quot;bikes&quot;) with another bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option #1: The BOB Yak trailer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I first saw this method employed by my good friend Jeff. We were riding to the start of the Almanzo in 2009, and he wanted to haul his steamroller with his Karate Monkey. The ride down featured a consistent 30+mph headwind (Jeff still managed an 8th place finish and 1st overall in the fixed gear category), and the rig made it. At that point it became a totally viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/8081287571/&quot; title=&quot;Transporting a bike on a BOB yak by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8054/8081287571_afab861bc2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Transporting a bike on a BOB yak&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/8081287495/&quot; title=&quot;Car rack parts by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8048/8081287495_184b1ab3db_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Car rack parts&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/8081287431/&quot; title=&quot;The wheel &amp;quot;tray&amp;quot; by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8326/8081287431_151ff60fe0_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The wheel &amp;quot;tray&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; relatively quick to set up and load (albeit awkward), works with any bike that will pull a BOB, good manueverability, fender compatible, and capable of fast moving speeds.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;easily tipped over, bad in crosswinds, shimmies downhill, and awkward unloading.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: &lt;/strong&gt;the trailer is around $300, but is a good light duty all purpose cargo hauler. The fork mount will add another $15-20. Given the trailer&#039;s versatility, I&#039;d consider the cost to be quite low.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; I averaged 13mph with the above setup for my commute home.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance: &lt;/strong&gt;I took this setup about 5 miles, but I could have taken it much farther. The handling of the bike was neutral, with only a bit of wind induced shimmy.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product link: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bobgear.com/yak&quot;&gt;http://www.bobgear.com/yak&lt;/a&gt; (available by special order, but you&#039;re welcome to try mine)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The perceived limitations of the untrained individual</title>
 <link>http://bicyclechain.com/node/127</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-addthis field-type-addthis field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style  &quot; addthis:title=&quot;The perceived limitations of the untrained individual - Bicycle Chain&quot; addthis:url=&quot;http://bicyclechain.com/node/127&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_google_plusone&quot; g:plusone:size=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactions were mixed when I informed my coworkers that I&#039;d convinced Bryce to do a 20 mile run at the River Bottoms with me. Some people thought I was a jerk, while others knew that I simply didn&#039;t know any better. Despite recently acquired anecdotal evidence to suggest otherwise, I steadfastly adhere(d) to the notion that any willing, physically fit person is capable of running twenty miles, if paced appropriately. In short, go the proper degree of fastand you can get really far. See?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we met up at some point in the morning, rode really slowly for an hour, and then traded our bikes for shoes. Normally I do not run with any techy gizmos, but since I wanted to be sure that we did not try too hard, I was equipped with a GPS and a heart rate monitor. The first mile was almost entirely sand. Given the terrain, I was expecting roughly ten minute miles and a heart rate barely inching into zone three. That seemed &#039;safe&#039;. Five minutes in, we were on pace for an 8m30sec first mile. I felt fine, but I knew we shouldn&#039;t go that fast. I did the responsible thing: I made us slow down. From here, we settled into a nice rhythm. The terrain became firmer and more consistent, my heart rate remained in zone three, and our mile splits were about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the raft, Bryce expressed a peculiar concern. He suggested that he might not be able to finish the run. I scoffed. I was filled with a mixture of disbelief and dislike. As if bartering with a child, I proposed eating disgusting amounts of fast food at the midpoint. We kept running. By the end of the seventh mile, however, it was clear that Bryce was done. He asked to walk. I said, &quot;sure.&quot; We were out of water, so the decision was either a.) walk for two hours back to the bikes without water, or b.) walk through the suburbs in search of Chipotle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were walking through the suburbs, Doug called for an unrelated reason, but quickly offered to pick us up and give us a ride back to our bikes. We met at Chipotle, ate lunch, and then returned to the spot where I was sure we&#039;d left the bikes. We ambled into the woods. Doug returned to his life. Something did not seem right. We were on the wrong side of Long Meadow Lake. We discussed a variety of dangerous, sketchy options before settling on a walk around the lake. I wasn&#039;t thrilled with the idea, but I also wasn&#039;t bothered by it. We traded shoes and were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk ended up being seven miles. We hopped on our bikes, picked up the lightrail, and returned to Minneapolis. In the end, it was an 8.5 hour, multi-modal adventure. Sometimes things don&#039;t work out the way you expect. It was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Gear test: Tiagra 4603</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-addthis field-type-addthis field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style  &quot; addthis:title=&quot;Gear test: Tiagra 4603 - Bicycle Chain&quot; addthis:url=&quot;http://bicyclechain.com/node/123&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_google_plusone&quot; g:plusone:size=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Triple&lt;/em&gt; has fallen out of favor in the past several years. SRAM has been leading the way, first by entering the road market without offering it as an option, and then by introducing the 2x10 to the mountain bike world (more recently the 1x11). The proposed compromise has been&lt;em&gt; the compact&lt;/em&gt;, a smaller spidered road crank most frequently featuring a 34/50 ring combination. Combined with a wider range cassette, the compact--with just two rings--produces a gear range that offers the same high and low end. On paper, it makes sense. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, this can work very well on a road bike where speeds are usually above 20mph. This puts the rider in the large chainring and a good position in the cassette. The shifts are consistent, with small percentage changes, and the chainline is relatively straight. The small chainring is then reserved for extremely steep or extended climbs. Now, let&#039;s consider a rider who spends more of her or his time between 17mph and 19mph. Assuming an 11-28 cassette and a preferred cadence of 90rpm, you will either find yourself in the 50 tooth ring using the 17, 19, and 21 cogs, or in the 34 tooth ring using the 12, 13, and 14 tooth cogs. In the case of the former, it means 10.5-14.3% jumps (sort of defeats the purpose of cramming more gears in the back) between gears and a poor chainline. In the case of the latter, the percentage changes are a much more desirable 7.1-8.3%, but the chainline will be poor, with the likelihood of the chain rubbing on the inside of the large chainring being somewhere between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;near certainty&quot;. Furthermore, SRAM does not offer a trim position that allows for the use of those gears without negatively affecting the lower gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to the triple. For many people, it is still a much more desirable option than a double. It offers sufficient options both at the high and low end, with the middle chainring positioned optimally to provide tightly spaced gearing and a good chainline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve recently converted my commuter/touring machine to the new 10 speed, Shimano Tiagra triple drivetrain. It is one of a handful of remaining options, and considered a &lt;em&gt;mid-level&lt;/em&gt; option. I intend to post an ongoing series documenting my experiences with it in terms of functionality and durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The feel is a bit &quot;softer&quot; than other, higher end Shimano shifters that I have used, including 10 speed Dura Ace and Ultegra. Shifting is still reliable and responsive. It&#039;s primarily a sensation at the lever to which one quickly acclimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each chainring has two trim positions, so nearly all of the gears are accessible. I still try to shift responsibly, but it&#039;s nice to be able to quickly eliminate the sound of a rubbing front derailleur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the new Shimano road derailleurs are equipped to handle a 30 tooth cog. I am stretching its limits a bit with an XT 11-32 cassette, but everything is working great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This version of Tiagra uses the somewhat annoying 92bcd inner chainring that bolts to the middle chainring. This trend began several years ago with Dura Ace, and has since worked its way to Ultegra and Tiagra (Dura Ace is no longer offered in a triple configuration). This limits the inner ring to a 30 tooth, and requires proprietary stuff. Tsk Tsk. I&#039;d prefer a more &lt;em&gt;normal &lt;/em&gt;74bcd with the inner ring attaching directly to the crankarm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>First unofficial Veloviet ride of the year</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday and its outrageously nice weather brought a return to the road bike for many. I was one of those people. The Veloviet cycling team had its first &quot;unofficial&quot; ride of the year from Pho Tau Bay in Minneapolis. We&#039;ve been working with Veloviet for the past three years now, and have come on board as an official sponsor in the past year. I&#039;ve enjoyed both working and riding with them, and was delighted to find out that the first ride of the year would start so near my house. After hastily throwing a bike together on Friday, I was ready. Coworker, friend, and general &lt;em&gt;goodguy&lt;/em&gt; Kai met me at my house, and we made the three mile journey to the start of the ride. Quang was uncharacteristically late, so I had some time to get re-acquainted with some of the people with whom I&#039;ve either never ridden, or done so sparingly. After a brief photo opportunity, we were on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the ride was very docile. It was a good opportunity to chat and re-acclimate to the nuances of riding a road bike in a group. Once we reached the river road the pace began to quicken. It was fun and exhilarating. We looped into Mendota and up Highway 13, where the real ride began. Jim, Quang, and Bart were clearly ready to have a little fun and test the spring fitness. I took it easy and just followed. There was no sense upping the ante before reaching Ohio and Ramsey. Of course, it didn&#039;t really matter, as there were plenty of other riders who were ready and able to &lt;em&gt;throw down&lt;/em&gt; before we reached the climbs. Although I&#039;ve been riding without a cycling computer, I can guesstimate that our speed through Lilydale was 28-30mph. It felt crazy compared to the plodding pace that I&#039;ve established over the winter. I just followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached Ohio. Bart seemed crazy strong, so I decided to follow his wheel and hope for the best. I picked the right horse and he dragged me to the top before Quang had a chance to unleash his frenzied attack. It was surprising, but I was feeling great. I expected the combination of not enough time on the bike, too much running, and nursing my wisdom teeth for the past week and a half would make it a difficult ride. We reached Ramsey, climbed it at a reasonable pace without any real shenanigans, and returned to Minneapolis via Summit. It was a beautiful day to be on the bike, made only better by riding with a great group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve wanted a Salsa Fargo since I first spied photos of it on the interwebs months prior to its release. &lt;em&gt;This thing...this thing...is amazing.&lt;/em&gt; My opinion of that has been somewhat tempered over the years, as I&#039;ve come to realize that for most things its amenities are perhaps...*ahem* gratuitous. Fine. Whatever. Nonetheless, presented a unique opportunity to own a Fargo, I knew that I needed to take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6924278391/&quot; title=&quot;P1040485 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7194/6924278391_e8d5bebb97.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;P1040485&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built it up with SRAM X9, Hope Pro II hubs, Stan&#039;s Arch EX rims, Continental Race King 2&quot; tires, Thomson stem/post, Woodchipper bars, and a Chris King headset. The vision at this point is to use it for non-technical singletrack/mixed terrain riding (example: taking the long route through the River bottoms on my way to work), a handful of gravel events, and perhaps a more ambitious dirt tour towards autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I went to the Frozen Fat Forty. It was a fat bike only mountain bike race on the relatively new trails at Elm Creek. From the moment Ugur dropped me off, I could tell that it would be a well run and incredibly enjoyable event. The sponsors were into it. It wasn&#039;t just another event with obligatory product placement and shop/organization promotion. It was cool. I stayed near the back at the Le Mans style start. I wasn&#039;t aiming to be particularly competitive as 1.) I don&#039;t often &quot;race&quot; mountain bike type events, and 2.) I could only race for ~four hours before I needed to leave for a wedding. The format was a bit loose, but you could either compete for fastest to four laps (~40 miles) or go for the most laps in six hours. The first part of the race featured clustered groups. With over fifty participants it was bound to go that way. For a while I rode behind someone who suffered the misfortune of a blown up alfine, and consequently was riding a ratio something like 1:2. It was fun to watch. I could tell that on a properly functioning bike he would have been one of the fast ones. Eventually I passed him and things thinned out. For the next two and a half laps I rode primarily by myself, passing only a handful of people and not getting passed. It was peaceful. The trail was in great shape. By the third lap the sun had created some muddy spots, but all things considered the event benefitted from some good luck. I finished my third lap and waited for Michelle to pick me up. Great day. The photo below appears on the 45nrth Facebook page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/45nrth/&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/45nrth/&lt;/a&gt;) and appropriate photo credit goes to them. Please check out their site if you&#039;re in the market for fat bike tires, especially for singletrack use. The top three finishers were all rolling the Husker Du front and rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I took my first trip to QBP&#039;s annual Frostbike event. I was in awe. There were interesting things everywhere and I hadn&#039;t even left the building before pre-spending my next several paychecks. That was a more carefree time in my life. Now I nod contemplatively, make notes on items/innovations that might be relevant to our customers, and chat with seldom seen acquaintances from the cycling world. It is also a time when I am generally successful at luring coworkers into riding their bikes with me. On this occasion the plan was hatched that I would ride to Saint Paul, meet Dave, and then ride to Bloomington where we would hook up with Bryce and Doug. The weather forecast was this: brilliant, in an almost unsettling way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started early. I left for Dave&#039;s at 6:30am. It was still dark and there was no traffic. It was perfectly serene until my first flat. Okay. Whatever. That sort of thing happens. I changed it, disconcerted that in spite of ten minutes of combing the tire, I was unable to find the source (even after locating the puncture in the tube). Sigh. I focused my psychic energy on the conservation of this thin strip of rubber. &lt;em&gt;Do not flat...do not flat...&lt;/em&gt; I was now running late and had to ride up Summit much more quickly than I would have preferred. I made it to Dave&#039;s on time, but my rear tire had gone from blow-off-the-rim-2x25g-co2 firm to mister-wiggles-scary-in-the-corners squishy. I denied the reality of the situation, used Dave&#039;s floor pump to inflate it beyond 15psi, and we were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did not take long for reality to overcome my well intended delusion. I had another flat. We stopped to change it. The puncture in the tube was in the same location, so obviously I had missed &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I stared. I twisted my face and furrowed my brow. I felt. I dug. I asked Dave to do the same thing. We stood there for fifteen minutes trying to rationalize our shared inability to find the seemingly very obvious bit of debris that was lodged in my inappropriate-for-road-use-cx-tires. Nothing. I re-mounted the tire, inflated it, and we forged forward. &quot;What are you going to do if you keep flatting?&quot; &quot;Walk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we reached Fort Snelling I had warmed up and convinced myself that I might actually be able to make the trip without flatting again. A mysterious force must have removed the bit of debris. That&#039;s, of course, the only reasonable explanation. Riding through Fort Snelling was picturesque. The deer were out in numbers, the morning sun was casting dramatic shadows, and a slight mist in the air made the day feel fresh and invigorating. I was happy to be riding my bike. The rest of the ride went well. We carefully measured our pace and arrived with just minutes to spare before Dave&#039;s morning class on electronic Campagnolo bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my time wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6909520981/&quot; title=&quot;P1040447 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/6909520981_140faa392f.jpg&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;P1040447&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45north was showing off a studded Husker Du. I would have been especially excited for this tire in previous years, but this year we didn&#039;t have winter and my fat bike has been nothing more than an infrequently used novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6909521333/&quot; title=&quot;P1040448 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7176/6909521333_4fe636d1ce.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;P1040448&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salsa showed a lot of employee bikes, configured as they ride them. It was really interesting and inspiring to see the passion behind the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6909522405/&quot; title=&quot;P1040449 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7068/6909522405_3db75d6902.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; alt=&quot;P1040449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRAM showed off its new for 2012 Red lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6909523319/&quot; title=&quot;P1040455 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7047/6909523319_29827ac716.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;P1040455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All City had interesting new bikes with *gasp* derailleur hangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6909523683/&quot; title=&quot;P1040458 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/6909523683_4a2cc8c9da.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;P1040458&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, Civia showed its new direction. This is probably the most promising news for us. Although we are not currently a Civia dealer, the new direction of increased accessibility for urban customers could potentially mesh very well with our shop. Rather than pricing themselves out of the market with admittedly cool high end town bikes, they&#039;ve focused on bikes that average people might find both practical and affordable. The only notable flaw with the new bike was the lack of fork crown clearance. The fork will change before it is officially released, but I am still skeptical of its ability to fit a studded tire and fender. Definitely worth a follow up look though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlupfer/6909525503/&quot; title=&quot;P1040479 by timlupfer, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7204/6909525503_f8f04c8617.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;P1040479&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Dave finished with his class we ate lunch and then met up with Bryce and Doug, both of whom were obviously enjoying the balmy weather and abundant sunshine. It was a spirited return trip full of good riding and conversation. We stopped briefly at Fort Snelling to bask in the sunshine and enjoy a snack. Overall, it was a lovely day and a fantastic weekend. Thanks dudes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;certainly, got some big air. and we didn&#039;t fall through the surface of the lake...either day! how lovely! not falling into the icy, deathless/ful abyss in search of numeric repetition while impulsively brain-scanning for those lovely, throaty memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the events will have to be slightly rearranged, but that will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
