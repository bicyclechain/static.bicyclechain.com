&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young&#039;s modulus is the ratio of a materials reaction to loads of stress and strain, and any scientist will tell you that some substances readily &quot;spring back,&quot; [in an elastic fashion], while others are permanently deformed [the in-elastic reaction].  However it is made, all substances have an elastic limit, the point at which they no longer &quot;spring back.&quot;  I believe in an Athletic Modulus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;A.M = mental stress / physical strain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as such, our &lt;em&gt;athletic limit&lt;/em&gt; is when our actions cause us to be unable to continue, or induce the notorious &lt;em&gt;BONK&lt;/em&gt;!  Also, I believe that we all have within us an Athletic Modulus number, and that this number can be changed through training.  Some people it would seem have infinite mental capacity to withstand the athletic endeavor, think Ultra-marathoners, while others, like Power Lifters, can strain tissue to the very limit.  Where ever we are on this spectrum, our greatest athletic achievements lie right at the point of maximum physical strain, and the mental fortitude to endure it.  So the recipe is mental and physical efforts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with less time available to me, I decided to run short, but to do so at a solid pace, leading to another Personal Best, or Personal Record!  My numbers are not outstanding, but the idea is.  I &lt;em&gt;decided&lt;/em&gt; I was going to push myself hard, and I had the will to hold the physical effort...  Some days you have just the perfect combination.  After the run, with frosted lungs, and soaking shirt, I went to my log book and discovered that I had shaved a few seconds off my previous P.B. and the effort was all worth it.  Frankly, as an age group dreamer, I need all the reasons to celebrate that I can get.  Like you, I sacrifice, for what will probably be nothing more than a delusion, but these little victories along the way make it all the more worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>End of a Big Week</title>

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;9+ miles swimming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;220 miles tri-biking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;49+ miles running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;7 &quot;bricks&quot; in all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The best day was Wednesday, with a 120 km bike followed immediately by a 13.2 km run.  I called it &quot;Big Wednesday,&quot; after the great John Milius movie.  Any way, now I move into a recovery phase, and it&#039;s back to school!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Thoughts About Training Plans</title>

 <title>A Change in Plans</title>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&quot; class=&quot;addthis_button_google_plusone&quot; g:plusone:size=&quot;standard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given lemons, so the saying goes, make lemonade; and training is no different.  The plan for today was going to be &quot;Marathon Monday.&quot;  Four 10+ km runs, seperated by an hours rest between each.  A good plan, and a strong way to spend seven hours!  However, when I got out of bed this morning, the calves were quite tight, and the legs we not fresh and ready.  So what to do?  At this point is is important to listen to the body and make an appropriate change in plans.  The weather is still great, and my goal is to build a respectable total of miles on the bike this week, so I changed plans and took the bike out, then finished with a 10.66 km run.  I may not have the pure running miles that I wanted for today, but instead I now have four &quot;brick,&quot; workouts, in five days, and that is very respectable.  I&#039;ll finish today with a quality recovery pace swim.  More on training plans later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
